Lake view and pretty setting aside, the well-curated food menu at New Sarovar boasts of over 150 delicacies across various cuisines. From Italian to Oriental, Afghan, Goan and more, youâ€™ll be spoilt for choices here! For starters, we ordered the stuffed braised mushroom and the barbecued honey glazed chicken and loved them. Love seafood? order the Cajun spiced prawns or the batter fried squid. We recommend you try the Sarovar special murg mussalam and the Malabar fish curry with either butter naan or matka biryani, for your main course. If you want to try Oriental, go for pomfret fillet in garlic chilli, veg Thai spring rolls and country-side chicken hakka noodle. End your dinner on sweet note with either triple sundae or double-layered chocolate mousse or shahi tukda.
